Tables with Structure:

Villagers
Minerals 
Crops (possibly need to add fruit from fruit trees)
Recipes
Artifacts 
Fish 

Tables I need to structure:

Resources (Types: Basic, Ore, Bar)
Monsters 
Weapons
Artisan Goods
Foraged Items 
Craftable Goods 
Trees (common, special and fruit types)
Hats 
Footwear
Rings 
Achievements 

Confused Tables Maybe Whatever:
Fertilizer (Rations and percentages for different quality crops)
Buildings (Types: Merchants, Houses/Residences/, Farming, Special, Other)
Bait (small, should I bother?)
Tackle (small, should I bother?)
Furniture (Just a name, price and image. Lots of different types, chair, couches etc)
Quests (complicated structure)
Bundles (def want but have to think of structure, necessary number of items vs items that satisy etc...)
