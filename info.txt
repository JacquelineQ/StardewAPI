Will need to convert achievement value for Hats to reference later 

Need to change single to double quotes in a lot of data files since apostrophes
    happen sometimes/consistency

What is the currency at Qi's Casino??? Qi coins!

Hats section tells how to obtain through Achievements, not merchant availability, possibly need to add later

Tables with Structure:

Villagers
Minerals 
Crops (possibly need to add fruit from fruit trees)
Recipes
Artifacts 
Fish 
Weapons
Hats 
Footwear
Rings 
Achievements 
Craftable Goods 
Foraged Items 


Confused Tables Maybe Whatever:
Fertilizer (Rations and percentages for different quality crops)
Buildings (Types: Merchants, Houses/Residences/, Farming, Special, Other)
Bait (small, should I bother?)
Tackle (small, should I bother?)
Furniture (Just a name, price and image. Lots of different types, chair, couches etc)
Quests (complicated structure)
Bundles (def want but have to think of structure, necessary number of items vs items that satisy etc...)
Monsters (so many different subtypes)
Resources (Types: Basic, Ore, Bar)
Trees (common, special and fruit types)
Artisan Goods (big structure variation based on type)
