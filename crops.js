// Not sure if I can resturn crops by grow season unless I set every season as a boolean 
// And I dont think that works either lmao
// Okay made that work but it looks like I could have done this without including the extra values like growsSpring,
// will leave for now and possibly rewrite later
// Should I include Pierre and JojaMart seed prices?
// Should I include value for each type of quality?

// Included seed prices, are a number type and are 0 if N/A (ie not available to purchase from Piere or Joja)

    notes: "Wild Seeds can be crafted out of foraged plants once you learn the recipe at the appropriate foraging level (Spring at level 1, Summer at level 4, Fall at level 6, Winter at level 7). Each recipe will produce 10 seed packets. When planted, wild seeds will randomly grow into one of that season's foraged plants. Regardless of what ends up growing, wild seeds all take the same amount of time to grow to maturity (7 days, not counting the day planted). Crows do not attack crops grown from Wild Seeds, so the use of Scarecrows is unnecessary. Since these seeds grow Forage crops, they will be of iridium quality if the Botanist Profession is chosen.",
